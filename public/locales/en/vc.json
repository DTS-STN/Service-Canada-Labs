  "scenarioPart1": "Mary loses her job. She applies for Employment Insurance. Two or three weeks go by, and she’s starting to wonder about the status of her application, and why she has not been paid. ",
  "scenarioPart1-1": "Looking for answers, she logs into the Service Canada Digital Centre finds a new message in her inbox.",
  "scenarioPart2": "Mary doesn’t normally use chatbots. However, since the chatbot says it might be able to help, she gives it a try. After a few exchanges, she learns that her previous employer never submitted her Record of Employment. ",
  "scenarioPart3": "Luckily, the Virtual Assistant has a solution. With Mary’s approval, the Virtual Assistant sends an email to Mary’s previous employer, requesting that they submit a Record of Employment as soon as possible. Mary is relieved. The Virtual Assistant saved her from having an awkward conversation with her previous employer, and took action to get her payments started as soon as possible. ",
  "scenarioPart4": "The Virtual Assistant offers to inform Mary when the Record of Employment comes in. Mary is pleasantly surprised when the Virtual Assistant offers to notify her by email, text message or both. She chooses both. Finally, the Virtual Assistant asks Mary to rate the service she received out of 5. Mary gives it a 4, and logs out of the Service Canada Digital Centre.  ",
  "scenarioPart4-1": "This experience informs Mary of the block on the file and guides her towards a solution to getting her benefits faster. ",

However, we still haven’t received a Record of Employment from your previous employer, [previous employer]. If you like, I can send a follow up email from the Government of Canada. That usually does the trick 😉” ",
