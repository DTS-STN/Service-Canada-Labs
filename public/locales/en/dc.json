  "ProductGoal1": "The goal of the Digital Centre is to bring the experience of visiting a Service Canada location online.  Think of it as the “home base” where your new Service Canada experience will happen. Our goal is to empower you to learn about benefits and services specific to your situation, and then apply for and manage your benefits.",
  "ProductGoal2": "This is also the place where you will create an account, have your identity verified, and later, log in. The Digital Centre will collect your benefit choices and profile and share this with frontline Service Canada staff. If you decide to call or visit a location, staff will already have your account information to serve you faster.",
  "ProductGoal3": "We are still thinking about how this will all work, but below are 4  ideas that we think might make it easier for you to receive benefits and services from the government. Keep in mind these are not final designs and we are looking forward to getting feedback from you on these ideas.",
